With all of the issues going on with reddit, I've been looking for a new place to call home... or at least, to spend my idle time reading interesting things. I came across [Tildes](https://tildes.net) suggested in a couple of places, and sent an email requesting an invite. In the meantime, I browsed a bit and got to know the culture and atmosphere of the site. I got invited earlier last week, but have still spend a lot more time lurking than posting. I actually got the nerve to make a couple of posts that were well-received, but I find I don't have much to add to a lot of the discussions that are already ongoing. Part of this is due to the formatting of the site - the reply textbox is below all of the other comments so you are expected to read everything before you add your own top-level reply. I have noticed that this does tend to cut down on many people saying the same thing over and over again because they didn't even bother to read any of the thread they're responding to.

Overall, I do feel like it's going to be an adequate Reddit replacement for me. I like the more "mature" discussions that do tend to be longer-form in nature. I like that there aren't stupid jokes everywhere in a race to the bottom for magic internet points. It's just a group of people engaging in (mostly) good faith discussions about various topics. And that's the best anyone can ask for, really.
